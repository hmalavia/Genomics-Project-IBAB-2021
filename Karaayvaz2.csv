We used the SomaticIndelDetector tool that is part of the GATK for indel calling. MuTect was run in paired mode using CEPH1408 as the project normal.,copy number variants were identified using RobustCNV, an algorithm in development at the Center for Cancer Genome Discovery at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. RobustCNV relies on localized changes in the mapping depth of sequenced reads in order to identify changes in copy number at the loci sampled during targeted capture. This strategy includes a normalization step in which systematic bias in mapping depth is reduced or removed using robust regression to fit the observed tumor mapping depth against a panel of normals (PON) sampled with the same capture bait set. Observed values are then normalized against predicted values and expressed as log2 ratios. A second normalization step is then done to remove GC bias using a loess fit. Finally, log2 ratios are centered on segments determined to be diploid based on the allele fraction of heterozygous SNPs in the targeted panel.,normalized coverage data was next segmented using Circular Binary Segmentation (Olshen et al., 2004) with the DNAcopy Bioconductor package. Finally, segments were assigned gain, loss, or normal-copy calls using a cutoff derived from the within-segment standard deviation of post-normalized mapping depths and a tuning parameter which is set based on comparisons to array-CGH calls in separate validation experiments.,Genome_build: hg19,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text files representing: copy number values for each gene in each sample (gene_level_calls.txt); copy number values for each chromosome arm in each sample (arm_level_calls.txt); copy numebr variants (indels_phased.txt),GPL16791,Simona,,Cristea,Biostatistics and Computational Biology,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,450 Brookline Ave.,Boston,Massachusetts,02215,USA,0,Illumina HiSeq 2500,other,genomic,OTHER,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN09789712,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX4526868,NONE
