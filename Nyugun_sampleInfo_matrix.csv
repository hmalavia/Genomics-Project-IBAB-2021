Dissociated samples were digested overnight in DMEM (Corning 10-013-CV) with Collagenase Type I, 2 mg/mL (Life Technologies 17100-017). Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA). Single-cell RNA isolation and amplification were performed using the Fluidigm C1 Single Cell Auto Prep IFC following the Fluidigm Protocol: 100-7168 I1.

Quantification of cDNA libraries was performed using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies Q32851) and high-sensitivity DNA chips (Agilent. 5067-4626). Quantification of library construction was performed using KAPA qPCR (Kapa Biosystems KK4824). For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq libraries, we generally multiplexed 96 cells per lane on an Illumina HiSeq2500 resulting in a calculated depth of ~1.6 million reads per cell (Illumina Rapid PE kit v2 402-4002 and Rapid SBS kit v2 FC 401-4022).,9606,,After demultiplexing sequencing libraries to individual cell FASTQ files (observed average read depth per cell was found to be ~1.6 Million reads), each library was aligned to an indexed GRCh38 RefSeq genome using RSEM version 1.2.1242, and bowtie2 version 2.2.3 with the following options enabled: rsem-calculate- expression -p $CORES -- bowtie2 -- paired-end -output- genome-bam.

Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA).

Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA). Single-cell RNA isolation and amplification were performed using the Fluidigm C1 Single Cell Auto Prep IFC following the Fluidigm Protocol: 100-7168 I1.

Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA). Single-cell RNA isolation and amplification were performed using the Fluidigm C1 Single Cell Auto Prep IFC following the Fluidigm Protocol: 100-7168 I1.

Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA).

Viable organoids were separated using differential centrifugation and viably frozen in 50% FBS (Omega Scientific FB-12), 40% DMEM, and 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D8418) by volume.,polyA RNA,Viable organoids were thawed and washed using DMEM, and digested with 0.05% trypsin (Corning 25-052-CI) containing DNase (Sigma Aldrich D4263-5VL) to generate single cell suspension. Cells were stained for FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies for CD31 (eBiosciences 48-0319-42), CD45 (eBiosciences 48-9459-42), EpCAM (eBiosciences 50-9326-42), CD49f (eBiosciences 12-0495-82), SytoxBlue (Life Technologies S34857). We only proceeded with samples showing at least 80% viability as measured using SytoxBlue in FACS,Sorted cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of approximately 500 cells/µl. For microfluidics-enabled scRNAseq, cell suspensions were mixed with Fluidigm C1 Suspension Reagents (Fluidigm 100-5315) at a ratio of 8:2 before loading mix onto C1 chip (Fluidigm 100-5760). Bright field images of captured cells were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, Illinois, USA).
