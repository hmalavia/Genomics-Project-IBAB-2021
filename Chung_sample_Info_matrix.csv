Each suspension was loaded to 10-17um IFC for mRNA sequencing chip then cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed with SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clontech) in the C1TM Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm). RNA spike-ins 1, 4 and 7 from ArrayControl TM RNA Spikes (ThermoFisher) were added to the lysis mix for validation of array and batch effect. Bulk RNAs were extracted from ~1x10^5 cells of suspensions or tumor tissues using RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) and 10ng of total RNAs were amplified with SMARTer kit (Clonetech) under the same conditions as single cells.
